## Usual format
`%Title% - %Artist%[ - 12][-disco-vocal][-h4][<rating 0 to 3>]`
- 12 means 12-inch Vinyl (can also be 7 for 7-inch vinyl, or can be something else)
- h4 means good for driving (since h4 is the name of a headlight.  Sean's friend collects headlights)

## Paper addendum to missing paper notes
- [Some] don't say tape but do have tape number
- Seeburg: 10" record
- 3M is always giant cartridge

## Notes from follow-up meeting
- major delimiters: hyphen in between, whitespace ok but not required
- order
  - title
  - artist
  - 7,10,12 after album is inch size of vinyl, otherwise cd (could also be cd then album name, such as cd 40 for cd named 40 hits)
    - could also just contain word such as "tape" in Wwmd tape 29a6 for a station named WWMD and tape named 29a6
    - could also be radio, or yt for youtube
  - genre
    (sometimes a hyphen is missing here)
  - tags could be after album name, such as if I loved you - vocal - party
    - V for very relaxing
- song type (vocal, or I or i for instrumental)
- if says h4 (such as after vocal): named based on "h4 headlights"
- some more edge cases:
  - And I Love Her-Manny Kellem-LP-love is blue-I-2.ogg
  - Andrea - Bano & Power -tape-sempre-vocal-3.ogg
  - Born to Be Wild - Enoch Light -LP-whoever-vocal-party-3.ogg
    - where "love is blue" or "sempre" or "whoever" is the name of the collection
  - 4-68-3-Muzak-LP-4-68-I-1
    - where 4 is stream name, 68 is year (4 68 is album name)
  - Muzak tape 2,1 -I-1
    - where album is "Muzak tape 2" track is 1, I for Instrumental, rating 1
  - Blue Bayou - Muzak - LP-moe82-I-3
    - song name - artist - medium - album (muzak of the 80's published 1982) - type (instrumental) - rating
  -        -        - could also be nd something (for New Dimensions Volume 2, or first one with no volume #)
  - A Taste of Honey-Muzak-LP-4-68-I-1
  - "have" means stuff was extracted from it, and the rest is elsewhere

- new naming scheme to suggest: title - medium - album - artist - genre - type - rating - use
  - where type is vocal or I, and last hypen is optional, followed by something like party, or V for very relaxing
